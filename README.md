## Description

Any Web Dev needs a place on the web to call home. A place to showcase their talents to fellow developers, employers, and friends. As such I took that necessary step and wrote this. Now when people want to see my collection of works, they can just check out my link. This is only version 1.0. In the future I hope to keep updating this, not only as I create more projects, but also to fine-tune the CSS as I get more comfortable with the langugage. For now though, enjoy!

## Usage

If you want to use the format/color scheme, feel free. Besides that recommend this page to your friends who need a developer!

## Credits

I'd like to thank my instructor Anthony Maddatu for helping me with the specific flex-box syntax that gave me so much trouble!
